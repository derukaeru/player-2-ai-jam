This game was made for the Player2 AI NPC Jam!

It uses the Player2 AI NPC Addon for Godot that allows me to use AI to create interactable NPCs.
For this game, I used it to create a murder mystery detective game and the player has to create their own question for the NPCs themselves

This was made roughly in 25~ hours including all the code and art

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Download the game from itch.io or github
2. Extract the zip file to any folder
3. Run sleuth.exe
4. Play the game!
